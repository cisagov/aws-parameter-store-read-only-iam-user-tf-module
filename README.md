[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/molecule-packer-ci-iam-user-tf-module/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/molecule-packer-ci-iam-user-tf-module/actions)

A Terraform module that creates an AWS IAM user that can build AMIs via
packer and/or access SSM parameters.

Note that two AWS providers are required by this module:

* "aws" (default provider) - This provider must allow access to create IAM
  resources in the account where the SSM Parameter Store is located.  This
  is also the same account where the AMIs will be created.
* "aws.users" - This provider must allow access to create IAM resources in
  the account where the new user will be created.

See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) for more
details on Terraform modules and the standard module structure.

## Usage ##

```hcl
module "iam_user" {
  source = "github.com/cisagov/molecule-packer-ci-iam-user-tf-module"

  providers = {
      aws       = aws
      aws.users = aws.users
  }

  images_account_id = "111111111111"
  ssm_parameters    = ["/github/oauth_token"]
  user_name         = "test-ansible-role-cyhy-core"
  tags = {
    Team        = "VM Fusion - Development"
    Application = "ansible-role-cyhy-core testing"
  }
}
```

## Examples ##

* See the [example README](examples/README.md).

## Inputs ##

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-------:|:--------:|
| add_packer_permissions | Whether or not to give the IAM user the permissions needed by packer to create an AMI | bool | `false` | no |
| amiwrite_role_description | The description to associate with the IAM role (as well as the corresponding policy) that allows all of the EC2 actions needed to create an AMI.  Note that a \"%s\" in this value will get replaced with the user_name variable. | string | `Allows access to all of the EC2 actions needed to create an AMI for %s.` | no |
| amiwrite_role_name | The name to assign the IAM role (as well as the corresponding policy) that allows all of the EC2 actions needed to create an AMI.  Note that a \"%s\" in this value will get replaced with the user_name variable. | string | `EC2AMIWrite-%s` | no |
| images_account_id | The AWS account ID containing the SSM parameter store that the IAM user needs to read from and also where the user will be allowed to create images (if add_packer_permissions is true); if not provided, the current calling account ID is used | string | ID of calling account | no |
| parameterstorereadonly_role_description | The description to associate with the IAM role (as well as the corresponding policy) that allows read-only access to the specified SSM ParameterStore parameters.  Note that a \"%s\" in this value will get replaced with the user_name variable. | string | `Allows read-only access to SSM ParameterStore required for %s.` | no |
| parameterstorereadonly_role_name | The name to assign the IAM role (as well as the corresponding policy) that allows read-only access to SSM ParameterStore.  Note that a \"%s\" in this value will get replaced with the user_name variable. | string | `ParameterStoreReadOnly-%s` | no |
| ssm_parameters | The AWS SSM parameters that the IAM user needs to be able to read | list(string) | | yes |
| tags | Tags to apply to all AWS resources created | map(string) | `{}` | no |
| user_name | The name to associate with the AWS IAM user (e.g. test-ansible-role-cyhy-core) | string | | yes |

## Outputs ##

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| user_name | The IAM user's name |
| user_arn | The IAM user's ARN |
| access_key_id | The IAM access key ID |
| access_key_secret | The IAM access key secret |
